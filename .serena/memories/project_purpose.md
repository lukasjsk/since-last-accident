# Project Purpose

"Since Last Accident" is a comprehensive knowledge management system for tracking development team incidents, their solutions, and providing metrics on incident-free periods. The application combines:

- **Issue & Solution Database**: Comprehensive tracking of development team incidents and their solutions
- **Knowledge Base**: Searchable reference for future similar issues
- **Dashboard Analytics**: Real-time metrics and "Days Since Last Accident" counters
- **Authentication System**: Secure user authentication with role-based access control
- **MCP Integration**: Model Context Protocol server for AI access (planned)

The goal is to help development teams learn from past issues, reduce incident recurrence, and maintain visibility into team reliability metrics.
