# Functional Requirements

## Core User Stories
1. **Log Issues in Real Time**
    - As a developer, I want to document bugs/errors as they happen so that no issue is forgotten.
    - Example: Click "New Issue" to log details like title, description, project name, and steps to reproduce.

2. **Create Permanent Records of Fixes**
    - As a team lead, I want to attach solutions (code snippets, workarounds, or documentation) to each issue.
    - Example: Add comments, code diffs, or links to pull requests/commit logs.

3. **Search & Access Knowledge Base**
    - As a QA engineer, I want to search for existing issues and solutions to avoid repeating fixes.
    - Example: Search by keywords (e.g., "404 error"), project name, or issue type (e.g., "database timeout").

4. **Collaborate & Annotate**
    - As a team member, I want to add comments, upvotes, or tags to issues for context and prioritization.
    - Example: Add a "priority" tag (low/medium/high) or assign ownership.

5. **Export & Share Solutions**
    - As a developer, I want to export solutions as templates or share them with team members via links.
    - Example: Generate a PDF report of an issue and solution for documentation purposes.

6. **Analytics (Optional)**
    - As a manager, I want to view trends in recurring issues or frequently solved problems.
    - Example: Graphs showing "Top 10 Most Common Bugs" or "Solutions with Highest Upvotes."
